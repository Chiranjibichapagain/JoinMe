**💡 I would really like to solve or include**   
Clearly and concisely describe the problem you are trying to solve.   

*Ex. Currently, suggested activities are always presented in the same order, i.e. all previously seen activities have to do be dismissed before new ones are displayed.*   

**👶 How would a user describe this?**   
Describe how users are affected by statements users might make or a user story.  
  
  
*Ex. Why do I have  to see the same results every time I search? Why can't it remember that I don't want to play tennis?*   

**🏆 My dream solution would be**  
Describe the best possible scenario of this being implemented.  

*Ex. User is never presented with the same activity twice.*  

**:2nd_place_medal: But I'd also consider it solved if**    
Describe an implementation that would fulfill the basic wish but might need more work in the future.  

*Ex. User can flag 'not interested' on an activity and it won't be presented to this user again.*  

**💭 If you were doing it, what would you do?**   
If possible, describe the steps you would take to implement this.   

*Ex. I would add a functionality that remembers the events that have been viewed by an individual user*   
*1. add an array to the user profile of events they have views*   
*2. check against the array before displaying an event*    

**♻️ Additional context**  
Describe any other reasons that might make this feature necessary.  

*Ex. BigCompetitor has this function and users are switching to them for this reason.*    
*Ex. We have to implement this to comply with SomeLegalStandard.*    
*Ex. MarketingTeam is unable to perform ABX until ABZ has been enabled, costing them 1 billion nanodullar per day 💰*

**🚀 I'm ready for take off**
